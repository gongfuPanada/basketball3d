# Basketball 3D

_Sample Unity game - First person basketball game._

This is an example game from a Build 2016 session:

* [Building a 3D Game with Unity and Visual Studio in 30 Minutes](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/T607)

The Hoop asset was imported from this page:

* [Hoop 3D Model](http://archive3d.net/?a=download&id=efb427dd)


I wrote a simple blog post regarding this sample game:


* [Learning Unity3D in One Day](http://www.harrysmemo.com/post/143100753957/learning-unity3d-in-one-day)


### How to Get Started

Open the game folder, Basketball3D, in Unity, and try the game in the Play mode.
You can use a mouse (or, arrow keys) to move around,
and throw a ball using the "Fire1" button (e.g., left mouse button).
